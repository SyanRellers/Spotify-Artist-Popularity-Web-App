This project impliments a Mongodb database in the backend running on
Node.JS. The front end is handled with React, and the framework I utilize
throughout the application is axios and the Spotify API. 

The purpose of this web application is to allow users to:
    1. Login with their spotify account
    2. Search through the Spotify DB for different artists
    3. Display information that isn't commony accessable about the artists
        including their follower count, popularity index, and main genre.
    
The webpages I utilize are a DB log page (in the backend) and a react component
page on the front end that responds to user input.

The Database stores a log of the user IDs of the individuals who have accessed
this webpage and successfully logged in. The Database runs on port 5000 and the 
front end on port 3000.

If there are any questions or concerns, you can reach me at rpsdfv@umsystem.edu
or via my cell (314)706-2257.

NOTE: THIS APPLICATION ONLY WORKS IF YOU HAVE A VALID SPOTIFY ACCOUNT
